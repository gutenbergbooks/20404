<p>The original book was wider than it was tall; the cover picture shows
the proportions. Some compromises had to be made in laying out this html
version. The decoration accompanying &ldquo;Hop Picking&rdquo; was
rotated clockwise, and a few text passages were separated from their
accompanying picture.</p>

<p>The beginning of each poem should look something like this:</p>

<p class = "illustration">
